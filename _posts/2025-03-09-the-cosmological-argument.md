# The Cosmological Argument of Thomas Aquinas

## 1. Introduction: Why Talk About the Cosmological Argument?

For many believers, the existence of God is accepted by faith. However, Christian thinkers have also used reason to support that faith. One famous way to do this is the Cosmological Argument, especially as explained by **Thomas Aquinas**. This argument shows that the universe cannot be explained solely by natural causes and that there must be a *First Cause—an Uncaused Cause*—whom we call God.

This guide is written in plain language so that Bible students, church goers, and anyone curious about the rational side of Christian faith can learn about this argument. We will discuss what the Cosmological Argument is, how Aquinas explained it, and what common questions and criticisms arise from it. We will also see how this line of thought is connected with what the Bible teaches about God.

The goal here is not to force anyone to accept a philosophical argument as the sole proof of God’s existence. Instead, the purpose is to explore a classical argument that many Christian thinkers have used to show that belief in God is not only a matter of faith but also of reason.

## 2. Understanding the Basics: Cause, Effect, and the Need for a First Cause

### 2.1 The Idea of Cause and Effect

Every day, we see many examples of cause and effect. For example, if you drop a glass, it shatters; if you plant a seed, it grows into a flower. This everyday observation forms one of the simplest foundations of the Cosmological Argument.

### 2.2 The Problem of an Infinite Chain

If everything we see has a cause, then what caused the cause? Could there be an endless chain of causes stretching back forever? Aquinas argued that while we see a long chain of causes in nature, there must be a starting point—a first cause that itself was not caused by anything else. This first cause, Aquinas argued, is God.

### 2.3 The Notion of a “Necessary Being”

Aquinas made a distinction between things that are “contingent” and things that are “necessary.” A contingent being is one that can either exist or not exist—its existence depends on something else. In contrast, a necessary being is one that must exist and cannot not exist. For Aquinas, the First Cause must be a necessary being. Because if the First Cause were contingent, then it too would need a cause. Thus, the idea of a necessary being helps us understand that the chain of causes must begin with something that does not depend on anything else—God.

## 3. Thomas Aquinas’ Five Ways: A Brief Overview

In his famous work, the Summa Theologica, Aquinas presents **five arguments** (or “ways”) to prove the existence of God. Here is a brief overview of these ways:

1. **The Argument from Motion**: Things in the world are in motion. Nothing can move itself. There must be a first mover—one who is not moved by anything else.
2. **The Argument from Causation**: Everything in the world is caused by something else. An infinite chain of causes is impossible. There must be an Uncaused Cause.
3. **The Argument from Contingency**: Many things in the world come into existence and pass away. If everything were contingent, then there would be a time when nothing existed. Since something exists now, there must be a necessary being that has always existed.
4. **The Argument from Degree**: Things in the world have varying degrees of qualities like goodness, truth, and nobility. These qualities imply the existence of an ultimate standard or maximum. This ultimate standard is God.
5. **The Teleological Argument (Argument from Design)**: There is purpose and design in the world. This design implies a designer, which is God.

In this post, we focus especially on the second way—the argument from causation (and parts of the first and third ways), which together form what many call the Cosmological Argument.

## 4. The Cosmological Argument: Step by Step

### 4.1 Observing the World

When we look around at the world, we see that everything seems to be the result of some cause. This observation—that everything in the universe has a cause—is the starting point for the argument.

### 4.2 The Problem of Infinite Regress

If every effect has a cause, one might ask: what caused the cause? If you follow the chain backwards, would it continue forever? Aquinas argued that an infinite chain of causes does not provide a satisfactory explanation. If there were no first cause, then there would be no way to explain why there is anything at all.

### 4.3 The Need for a First Cause

Because an endless chain of causes is not a complete explanation, there must be a first cause—something that caused everything else without itself being caused. Aquinas argued that this first cause must be a necessary being, a being that exists by its very nature and not because of something else. For Aquinas, this first cause is what we call God—a being that is uncaused, eternal, and necessary for the existence of all other things.

### 4.4 Connecting It to Our Experience

Consider everyday examples. When you see a plant growing, you know that it did not appear by itself. It needed water, sunlight, and soil. Yet, even these ingredients have their own explanations. Ultimately, though, the whole process must have a starting point—a source that is not dependent on anything else. Aquinas’ argument takes this simple idea and elevates it to a grand scale: the entire universe must have a cause, and that cause is God.

## 5. Explaining Aquinas’ View in Simple Terms

### 5.1 Everything Has a Cause

Every event or thing in nature happens because something else made it happen. There is a cause behind every effect we observe.

### 5.2 An Infinite Chain Doesn’t Explain Anything

If every effect has a cause, and every cause must have another cause, then if we follow this chain back, we would never reach a starting point. An endless chain of events leaves us with a problem: if there is no beginning, what started it all? Aquinas argues that an endless chain does not provide a satisfactory explanation for the existence of the universe.

### 5.3 There Must Be a First Cause

To avoid the problem of an infinite chain, there must be a first cause that itself was not caused by anything. This first cause is what makes everything else possible.

### 5.4 The First Cause Is What We Call God

For Aquinas, the first cause is not just any force or energy—it is a personal, intelligent being that we call God. This God is not part of the chain; rather, God is the source from which the chain begins. He is eternal, necessary, and uncaused, which makes Him fundamentally different from everything in the created universe.

## 6. Common Criticisms of the Cosmological Argument

### 6.1 The Possibility of an Infinite Series

Some critics argue that an infinite series of causes is possible. They say that if every event has a cause, it might be that there is no need for a first cause. In this view, the chain of causes could extend infinitely into the past.

**Response**: Imagine trying to build a tower of blocks without a bottom block. No matter how many blocks you stack, if there is no first block to support the rest, the tower cannot stand. Similarly, if there were an infinite chain of causes, there would be no foundation to support the existence of anything. Aquinas’ response is that an infinite regress does not provide an adequate explanation for why anything exists at all. Instead, we must have a first cause that is not itself caused—this is God.

### 6.2 Aquinas Was Not Debating Atheists

Another common point is that Aquinas was not trying to engage with atheists. Rather, he was explaining why belief in God is reasonable for those who already accept certain basic principles (like the existence of cause and effect).

**Response**: Aquinas did not set out to “prove” God in the way that modern debates sometimes demand. Instead, he was offering a rational explanation for why God must be the foundation of all that exists. His argument was meant to show that the Christian belief in God is not irrational or arbitrary, but is instead based on clear observations of the world. By demonstrating that everything in the universe has a cause and that this chain must have a beginning, Aquinas sought to show that believing in God is a natural and reasonable conclusion.

### 6.3 The Role of Empirical Evidence (Romans 1:19-20)

Some point to the Bible—specifically Romans 1:19-20—as evidence that empirical observations of the world are part of how God reveals Himself. Critics argue that because the world shows clear evidence of God’s work, we do not need a purely philosophical argument.

**Response**: The cosmological argument does not deny the role of empirical evidence. In fact, Aquinas and many Christian thinkers believe that God’s existence is evident both in nature and in the order of the universe. The Bible itself teaches that creation reveals God. Romans 1:19-20 tells us that God’s invisible qualities, including His eternal power and divine nature, are clearly seen in what has been made. Therefore, the cosmological argument is just one part of a larger picture. It uses both reason and observation to point to the truth of God’s existence.

## 7. Practical Implications for Believers

### 7.1 Strengthening Personal Faith

Reflecting on the idea that everything in the universe has a cause, and that there must be a first cause, can inspire a sense of awe and wonder. This perspective reminds us that the world is not a random accident but has a purpose and a foundation in a Creator who loves and sustains all things.

### 7.2 Helping in Apologetics

The cosmological argument offers a way to explain, in clear and simple terms, why the existence of the world points to a higher power. By sharing this argument, you can help others see that faith in God is supported by both personal experience and logical reasoning.

### 7.3 Encouraging Group Study and Discussion

Bible study groups and church classes can benefit from discussing the cosmological argument. As you share thoughts and ask questions together, you build a deeper understanding of both the natural world and your faith. This discussion can lead to more meaningful conversations about how God’s work is visible in everyday life.

## 8. Conclusion: The First Cause and Our Journey of Faith

In this post, we have explored the Cosmological Argument as developed by Thomas Aquinas. We have seen how the simple observation that every effect has a cause leads to the conclusion that there must be a First Cause—a necessary being who is not itself caused. Aquinas’ argument shows that the universe, with all its order and complexity, points to a Creator who set everything in motion.

This Creator, as many Christians believe, is God. Through the cosmological argument, we find a rational basis for our faith—a reminder that God is not a mysterious force but the very source of all existence. By understanding that the world is not an accident but the work of an eternal, uncaused cause, we are invited to live with greater confidence, trust, and awe.

Remember that no single argument can capture the full mystery of God. The cosmological argument is one of many tools that help us see the light of truth shining through the natural world and the Scriptures. It invites us to explore, ask questions, and deepen our relationship with the One who is the beginning and the end.

As you continue your journey of faith, take the time to reflect on these ideas. Read the Bible, pray, and engage with others in discussion. Whether you are a Bible student, a member of your church, or simply someone curious about the nature of God, the cosmological argument offers a way to think clearly about why there is something rather than nothing, and how that “something” points unmistakably to a Creator.

In the end, the truth that the universe has a beginning—a first cause—reminds us that God is real. He is not only revealed in the pages of Scripture but is also evident in every flower, every star, and every breath of life. And for those who seek Him, He stands as the eternal foundation upon which all existence is built.

May this exploration of the cosmological argument deepen your faith, inspire thoughtful conversation, and lead you to a greater understanding of the God who is the source of all life.
