# The Tapestry of Church History: First Five Centuries
## Comprehensive Study Guide

### Introduction: Why Church History Matters

Church history is the ongoing narrative of God's faithful dealings with His people, continuing the story found in Scripture. As Deuteronomy 8:2 commands, we are to "remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee" and share this knowledge with future generations (Psalm 78:5-6).

**Key Benefits of Studying Church History:**
1. **Continuation of God's Story**: Church history records the ongoing life and work of Christ in our world.
2. **Biblical Command**: We are instructed to remember God's dealings with His people throughout time.
3. **Clarification of Beliefs**: It provides context for evaluating our doctrines and practices.
4. **Protection Against Error**: Many contemporary errors are simply old heresies in new forms.
5. **Spiritual Mentorship**: It gives us examples of faithful believers who followed Christ despite challenges.

## I. First Century: The Church Begins (30-100 AD)

### A. Christ's Ministry and the Apostolic Foundation

Jesus fulfilled His promise in Matthew 16:18, "I will build my church." Through His life, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection, He established the foundation for His church and provided salvation for His people.

**The Apostolic Commission:**
- Before His ascension, Jesus commanded His followers to be His witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 1:8).
- The Holy Spirit's outpouring at Pentecost (Acts 2) empowered the apostles to begin this worldwide mission.

### B. Early Persecution

**Nero's Persecution (64-68 AD):**
- Following the Great Fire of Rome, Emperor Nero blamed Christians and initiated the first systematic persecution.
- Many believers were martyredâ€”crucified, burned alive, or sewn into animal skins to be killed by wild dogs.
- As Tertullian later observed, "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church" (Apologeticus, Chapter 50).

### C. Apostolic Missions

**1. Peter's Ministry:**
- Preached at Pentecost in Jerusalem (Acts 2)
- Ministered to Jewish and Gentile believers throughout Asia Minor (modern Turkey)
- According to tradition and his own writings, he later worked in Babylon (1 Peter 5:13)
- Tradition holds he was martyred in Rome under Nero, crucified upside-down at his own request

**2. Paul's Missions:**
- Three major missionary journeys (Acts 13-21)
- Established churches throughout Asia Minor and Greece
- Imprisoned in Rome (Acts 28); according to tradition, he was beheaded during Nero's persecution
- Wrote at least 13 epistles that became part of the New Testament canon

**3. Other Apostolic Missions:**
- Thomas is traditionally recognized as the apostle to Persia and India
- The Mar Thoma Church in Kerala, India, traces its origins to Thomas's evangelism
- Andrew reportedly preached in Scythia, Greece, and Asia Minor
- John ministered in Ephesus and was later exiled to Patmos, where he received the Revelation

### D. First Century Writings

**1. New Testament Formation:**
- The Gospels were written between approximately 50-90 AD
- Paul's epistles were composed between 49-67 AD
- The apostolic writings were circulated among early churches and recognized as authoritative

**2. Early Church Fathers:**
- Clement of Rome (c. 35-99 AD): His epistle to the Corinthians (c. 96 AD) is the earliest Christian document outside the New Testament
- Ignatius of Antioch (c. 35-108 AD): Wrote seven letters while journeying to his martyrdom in Rome
- Polycarp of Smyrna (c. 69-155 AD): Disciple of John who preserved apostolic teaching

---

## II. Second Century: Facing Opposition (100-200 AD)

### A. Persecution Intensifies

The Roman Empire viewed Christianity with increasing suspicion, particularly because Christians:
- Refused to worship the emperor
- Withdrew from many public activities associated with pagan worship
- Met in private, prompting rumors of immoral conduct

**Notable Persecutions:**
- **Under Trajan (98-117 AD)**: Established legal procedures for trying Christians
- **Under Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD)**: Intensified systematic persecution
- **Martyrdom of Polycarp (c. 155 AD)**: When urged to renounce Christ, the elderly bishop famously replied: "I have served Him these eighty-six years, and He has done me no harm. How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?" He was burned at the stake for his faithfulness.

### B. False Teaching Emerges

**1. Gnostic Heresies:**
- Influenced by Greek dualism (spirit good, matter evil)
- Claimed salvation came through secret knowledge (gnosis)
- Denied God as Creator of the material world
- Rejected Christ's true incarnation
- Key proponents: Valentinus, Basilides, and Marcion

**2. Marcion's Error:**
- Rejected the Old Testament and its God
- Created a reduced "canon" of Luke and ten Pauline epistles
- This heresy prompted the church to clarify the biblical canon

**3. Montanism:**
- Founded by Montanus (c. 156 AD)
- Claimed direct prophetic revelations superseding apostolic teaching
- Emphasized extreme asceticism and imminent apocalypticism

### C. The Church's Response

**1. Development of Creeds:**
- Early confessions of faith affirmed:
  - One true God as Creator
  - Jesus Christ as both fully God and fully man
  - The historical events of Christ's life, death, and resurrection

**2. Formation of the Canon:**
- Churches began formulating lists of recognized apostolic writings
- The Muratorian Fragment (c. 170 AD) is the earliest known canonical list

**3. Rise of Apologists:**
- Justin Martyr (c. 100-165 AD): Former philosopher who defended Christianity to Roman authorities
- Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130-202 AD): Wrote "Against Heresies" to counter Gnosticism and uphold apostolic teaching

---

## III. Third Century: Defending the Faith (200-300 AD)

### A. The Christian Apologists

Following Peter's instruction to give a "reason" (Greek: apologia) for their hope (1 Peter 3:15), Christian thinkers systematically defended the faith against both persecution and false teaching:

**1. Justin Martyr (c. 100-165 AD):**
- Former philosopher who wrote "Apologies" addressed to Roman emperors
- Argued that Christianity fulfilled the best of Greek philosophy
- Martyred in Rome for refusing to sacrifice to pagan gods

**2. Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130-202 AD):**
- Disciple of Polycarp (who had been taught by John)
- Primary work: "Against Heresies" countering Gnosticism
- Emphasized the "rule of faith" passed down from the apostles

### B. Origen of Alexandria (c. 185-254 AD)

At just eighteen, Origen became head of Alexandria's catechetical school. His contributions were significant though mixed:

**Strengths:**
- Prolific biblical commentator and textual scholar
- Produced the Hexapla, a six-column comparison of Old Testament versions
- Defended Christianity against pagan philosopher Celsus

**Weaknesses:**
- Influenced by Platonic philosophy
- Developed allegorical interpretation that sometimes neglected literal meaning
- Some teachings (such as universal salvation) were later deemed heterodox

### C. Tertullian of Carthage (c. 155-220 AD)

A brilliant North African lawyer converted to Christianity who became a leading theologian:

**Contributions:**
- First to use the term "Trinity" in defending orthodox doctrine
- Confronted modalism (a heresy denying the distinct persons of the Trinity)
- Famous quote: "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church"

**Later Life:**
- Concerned about moral laxity in the church
- Joined the Montanists, a charismatic sect emphasizing new revelations
- His later rigorism diminished his influence in the catholic (universal) church

### D. The Word and Spirit Together

The third century highlights a crucial lesson for all believers:

1. **Scripture's Authority:** Never separate the Spirit of God from the Word of God.
2. **Spirit's Illumination:** Depend on the Holy Spirit's guidance to properly understand Scripture.
3. **Christ's Example:** Jesus demonstrated living in obedience to God's Word through the Spirit's power.
4. **Balanced Approach:** Even gifted theologians like Origen and Tertullian struggled to maintain this balance.

## IV. Fourth Century: Storms and Transitions (300-400 AD)

### A. Diocletian's Great Persecution (303-313 AD)

The century began with Emperor Diocletian's brutal empire-wide persecution:

**Key Features:**
- Destroyed Christian meeting places and Scriptures
- Removed Christians from public offices
- Imprisoned and executed church leaders
- Despite its intensity, this persecution failed to extinguish Christianity

### B. Constantine's Conversion

**The Turning Point (312 AD):**
- Before the Battle of Milvian Bridge, Constantine claimed to see a vision of a cross with the words "In this sign, conquer"
- After victory, he embraced Christianity and issued the Edict of Milan (313 AD), granting religious tolerance
- Later established Constantinople as a "Christian capital"

**Mixed Legacy:**
- Ended systematic persecution of Christians
- Provided imperial support for church building and organization
- Blurred distinction between church and state
- Some "conversions" became politically motivated rather than spiritually genuine

### C. The Monastic Movement

As persecution eased and Christianity gained social acceptance, some believers became concerned about declining spiritual standards:

**Early Monasticism:**
- Anthony of Egypt (c. 251-356 AD): Retreated to the desert for a life of prayer and self-denial
- Pachomius (c. 292-348 AD): Established first organized monastic communities
- Spreading from Egypt to Palestine, Syria, and eventually Europe

**Motivations:**
- Desire for deeper spirituality
- Reaction against worldliness in the increasingly acceptable church
- Search for "martyrdom" through ascetic self-denial when blood martyrdom was no longer common

### D. The Council of Nicaea (325 AD)

**The Arian Controversy:**
- Arius, a presbyter from Alexandria, claimed Jesus was a created being
- His slogan: "There was a time when the Son was not"
- This theology denied Christ's eternal divine nature and threatened the foundation of Christian salvation

**Athanasius's Defense:**
- Championed the New Testament view of Christ as the God-man
- Argued that only one who is fully God could save humanity
- Despite exile five times for his stance, maintained his defense of orthodoxy
- Famous statement: "Athanasius against the world" (Athanasius contra mundum)

**The Nicene Creed:**
- Produced by the council to affirm Christ's full deity
- Declared Christ "begotten, not made, being of one substance (homoousios) with the Father"
- This doctrinal formula grounded the church in the biblical understanding of Jesus's person and work
- Further refined at the Council of Constantinople (381 AD)

### E. Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD)

Though his most influential work came in the 5th century, Augustine's conversion and early ministry occurred in the late 4th century:

**Dramatic Conversion:**
- After years following Manichaeism and pursuing "the pleasures of sin"
- Influenced by Ambrose of Milan and his mother Monica's prayers
- In 386 AD, hearing a child's voice say "Take up and read," he opened Paul's Epistle to the Romans (13:13-14)
- Experienced God speaking directly to him and embraced Christ by faith

**Early Ministry:**
- Ordained as presbyter in 391 AD
- Became Bishop of Hippo in 395 AD
- Began writing significant theological works

---

## V. Fifth Century: The Fall of Rome (400-500 AD)

### A. Rome's Collapse and Augustine's Response

**Historical Context:**
- 410 AD: Visigoths under Alaric sacked Rome
- 455 AD: Vandals sacked Rome again
- Many blamed Christianity for weakening the Empire

**Augustine's "The City of God":**
- Written in response to pagan accusations that Christianity caused Rome's fall
- Distinguished between the earthly city of man and the heavenly city of God
- Key quote: "Our commitment is not to eternal Rome. Our commitment is to Jesus Christ and exclusively to the kingdom He is building."
- Articulated a Christian philosophy of history and politics that would influence Western thought for centuries

### B. The Pelagian Controversy

**Theological Context:**
- Augustine had prayed: "Grant what Thou commandest, and then command what Thou wilt"
- Pelagius, a British monk, objected to this prayer as undermining human responsibility

**Pelagius's View:**
- Humans are born morally neutral, not with original sin
- Adam's sin affected only himself, not all humanity
- People can choose good or evil without divine assistance
- Salvation is earned through moral effort

**Augustine's Response:**
- Defended the Pauline doctrines of grace:
  - Original sin and total depravity
  - Human inability to save oneself
  - The necessity of God's prevenient grace
  - Predestination and the sovereignty of God in salvation

**Church's Decision:**
- Council of Carthage (418 AD) condemned Pelagianism
- Council of Ephesus (431 AD) reaffirmed this condemnation
- Semi-Pelagianism (a milder form) was later rejected at the Council of Orange (529 AD)

### C. The Council of Chalcedon (451 AD)

**Christological Controversies:**
- Nestorianism: Overemphasized distinction between Christ's divine and human natures
- Eutychianism: Claimed Christ's human nature was absorbed into His divine nature

**The Chalcedonian Definition:**
- Affirmed Christ is one person with two natures (divine and human)
- These natures are "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation"
- This formula remains the orthodox position on Christ's nature across Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant traditions

### D. Patrick: Apostle to Ireland (c. 389-461 AD)

**Captivity and Conversion:**
- Kidnapped by Irish pirates at sixteen
- Sold into slavery in Ireland as a herdsman
- During these years of hardship, he yielded his life to Christ

**Escape and Preparation:**
- Escaped slavery in his early twenties
- Returned home to Britain
- Received theological training and became a monk
- Experienced a vision calling him back to Ireland

**Missionary Labor (432-461 AD):**
- Returned to the very land of his captivity
- Evangelized pagan Irish tribes
- Established monasteries and churches throughout Ireland
- According to tradition, used the shamrock to explain the Trinity

**Legacy:**
- Christianity took firm root in Ireland
- Irish monasteries preserved learning during the Dark Ages
- Irish missionaries later re-evangelized parts of Britain and continental Europe

- We cannot earn or merit salvation through our own efforts

### C. Divine Providence

**Historical Perspective:**
- God worked through persecution to spread the gospel
- Unlikely individuals (like Augustine and Patrick) became powerful witnesses
- Even theological controversies clarified and preserved truth

**Application:**
- God works all things together for good (Romans 8:28)
- No circumstance is beyond God's redemptive purpose

### D. Truth Matters

**Doctrinal Clarification:**
- The early church fought to preserve essential doctrines
