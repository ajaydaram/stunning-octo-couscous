## Martin Luther

This letter is truly the most significant writing in the New Testament. It encapsulates the purest Gospel message. A Christian would do well not only to commit it to memory but also to engage with it daily, as though it were spiritual nourishment for the soul. The more one reads and reflects on this letter, the more valuable and delightful it becomes.

With this preface, I aim to provide an introduction to the letter, as far as God enables me, so that everyone may gain the deepest understanding of it. Over time, it has been obscured by unnecessary glosses and superfluous commentary, yet the letter itself remains a radiant light, capable of illuminating the entirety of Scripture.

To begin with, we must understand the key terms used in the letter, such as law, sin, grace, faith, justice, flesh, and spirit. Without a clear grasp of these terms, reading the letter will be of little benefit.

### The Law and the Heart

The term "law" here should not be understood in a purely human sense, as a set of regulations dictating what actions must or must not be performed. Human laws are satisfied by external works, regardless of the heart's disposition. However, God's law is differentâ€”it judges the innermost depths of the heart. It demands not only outward compliance but also inward sincerity. Any work performed without heartfelt devotion is condemned as hypocrisy and falsehood. As Psalm 116 declares, "All human beings are liars," for none can fully keep God's law from the heart.

Within every person lies an aversion to good and a craving for evil. Where there is no free and willing desire for good, the heart is not aligned with God's law. In such a state, sin is present, and the wrath of God is deserved, regardless of how virtuous or honorable one's outward life may appear.

### Faith and Justification

Faith alone justifies and fulfills the law. Through faith, the Holy Spirit is granted, transforming the heart to delight in the law and enabling good works to flow naturally. As St. Paul asserts in chapter 3, faith does not abolish the law but upholds and fulfills it.

True faith is a work of God within us. It transforms us entirely, renewing our hearts, minds, and all our faculties. It brings the Holy Spirit, who empowers us to live as new creations. Faith is a living, active, and powerful force that cannot remain idle. It naturally produces good works without being asked, just as fire naturally burns and shines.

### Grace and Gift

Grace refers to God's favor and kindness toward us, through which He pours Christ and the Spirit into our lives. Gifts, on the other hand, are the manifestations of the Spirit that grow within us over time. Grace ensures that we are already considered completely righteous before God, while the gifts begin their transformative work within us.

### The Struggle of Faith Against Sin

Believers are called to actively resist sin, subdue their flesh, and align their lives with the death and resurrection of Christ. This process is a lifelong endeavor, symbolized by Baptism, which signifies dying to sin and rising to a new life of grace. The ultimate goal is complete freedom from sin and eternal life with Christ.

### The Preacher's Duty

The primary duty of a Gospel preacher is to reveal the law and sin, rebuking everything in life that lacks the Spirit and faith in Christ as its foundation. By doing so, the preacher leads people to recognize their wretched state, fostering humility and a longing for salvation.

### Conclusion

This letter provides the richest possible teaching about what a Christian should know: the meaning of law, Gospel, sin, punishment, grace, faith, justice, Christ, God, good works, love, hope, and the cross. It serves as a summary of the whole of Christian and evangelical teaching and an introduction to the Old Testament. Every Christian should make this letter the habitual and constant object of their study. God grant us His grace to do so. Amen.
