# Summary of the Roman Catholic Theological Framework

## Key Points on Human Nature and the Fall

1. According to Rome, God created humans with his "image" but not immediately with his "likeness"
    - The image alone made humans natural beings (homo naturalis) suited for earth
    - With just the image, humans could do natural good works and attain earthly bliss
    - But without the likeness, they couldn't enter heaven or God's presence
2. God wished to elevate humans to supernatural heavenly glory
    - He equipped them with both his image and likeness
    - The likeness was a "superadded gift" (donum superadditum) to natural man
    - This gift enabled supernaturally good works that could earn heavenly salvation
3. The Fall's consequences
    - Humans lost the supernatural addition (likeness)
    - Natural strength was weakened but not entirely
    - Humans could still do naturally good works but these could only obtain earthly salvation
    - Grace became essential for salvation

## Grace and Christ's Role

1. Grace serves two functions:
    - Primary: "elevating grace" (gratia elevans) to lift natural man to the supernatural state
    - Secondary: "healing grace" (gratia sanans) to repair damage from sin
2. Christ's acquisition of grace
    - Acquired grace through his humiliation, especially in suffering and death
    - His humiliation was voluntary, not obligatory
    - His sacrifice was a "superfluous good work" (opus supererogatorium) of infinite value
    - Even a single drop of his blood would have been sufficient for redemption
3. The Church's role in distributing grace
    - Christ entrusted his "superabundant grace" to the church
    - The church is "the continuation of his incarnation"
    - Christ lives on earth through the church

## Church Structure and Authority

1. The Church as an institution of salvation
    - Not primarily an assembly of believers or community of saints
    - A supernatural institution established by God
    - Preserves and distributes saving grace and truth
2. Essential distinction between clergy and laity
    - "Teaching church" possesses and distributes salvation
    - "Hearing church" receives and enjoys it
    - This distinction reflected in church architecture (choir/nave separation)
3. The hierarchical structure
    - Bishops as central figures with apostolic succession
    - Lower ranks: presbyters, deacons, acolytes, exorcists, readers, doorkeepers
    - Higher ranks: archbishops, metropolitans, patriarchs
    - The Pope as the supreme authority and representative of Christ
4. Clerical power is twofold
    - Power of order (potestas ordinis): authority to perform religious acts
    - Power of jurisdiction (potestas jurisdictionis): authority to govern
    - This power is governing, not serving

## Sacraments and Their Function

1. Word and faith have subordinate, preparatory significance
    - Sacraments communicate grace ex opere operato (by virtue of the act performed)
    - Each sacrament confers special grace
2. Three hierarchical sacraments that leave a permanent mark:
    - Baptism: restores supernatural addition, removes guilt, incorporates into community
    - Confirmation: separates strong from weak, makes soldiers under Christ
    - Ordination: separates priests from laity, elevates them to Christ's likeness
3. Four reinforcing sacraments:
    - Communion, marriage, penance, and last rites
    - Strengthen received grace for specific goals
4. The sacrament of penance demonstrates the church's judicial character
    - Confession of sins to a priest-judge
    - Priest grants or withholds absolution
    - Temporary punishments may be assigned (prayers, fasts, alms)

## Grace, Works, and Salvation

1. Function of grace in the believer's life
    - Puts humanity "back to work"
    - A divine power/supernatural quality enabling good works
    - Not primarily restoration of God's favor but power to regain favor through works
2. Different paths to salvation
    - All must observe commandments
    - Some may follow additional "suggestions" voluntarily
    - Voluntary vows (chastity, poverty, obedience) offer faster, safer path
    - Worldly involvement carries dangers of stagnation or regression
3. The double standard and transferable merits
    - Monks, nuns, martyrs, and saints can perform "superfluous good works"
    - These merits increase the church's "spiritual treasure"
    - Church can distribute these merits through prayers, alms, masses, indulgences
    - This can reduce temporal punishments for the faithful
4. No certainty of salvation
    - Church "mixes hope and fear" regarding salvation
    - Only a few receive special revelation of salvation or papal declaration
    - Most believers go to purgatory to pay remaining temporal punishments

## The Afterlife

1. Different destinations after death
    - Old Testament faithful were in underworld until delivered by Christ
    - Unbaptized and children who died early have their own destination
    - Most faithful go to purgatory temporarily
2. Hierarchy in heaven
    - All receive the "golden crown" but some get additional "golden wreaths"
    - Blessed form a spiritual hierarchy like angels
    - Mary at the top, followed by patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, etc.
3. Different degrees of veneration
    - Latria: worship for God alone (and Christ's human nature)
    - Dulia: ordinary veneration for saints and their relics
    - Hyperdulia: higher veneration for Mary
    - "There are as many kinds of worship as there are degrees of excellence"
